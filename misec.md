What is #misec?

According to the [#misec website], “#misec launched with BSides Detroit 2011. We started with a simple idea: make the BSides experience an ongoing part of life in Southeastern Michigan. This expanded into monthly meet-ups, workshops, capture the flag teams, and more throughout the state. We continue to put on the Converge conference in Detroit.”

So what is it really? 

#misec is a group of really smart and talented people who get together in person and online to share great ideas, help each other grow, and just have a great time. I joined #misec a while back, honestly I forgot when, after a friend of mine introduced me to the group. At first I was worried and slightly intimidated. My friend had spent all his time hyping up this group and how smart everyone was, and I was worried that as a complete beginner that I would not be welcome. Oh how wrong I was. Everyone I’ve met at #misec over these last couple of years has been an absolute gem of a human being. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming, and all questions are taken seriously, regardless of complexity. 

I promise I’m not a #misec shill and I don’t get paid to promote #misec, so trust me when I say that it’s absolutely worth joining if you are the least bit interested in the information security field. There’s something for everyone at this group. There’s an online presence which is facilitated through slack (the link to join is on the #misec site). In addition, multiple cities in Michigan have chapters, including but not limited to Detroit, Lansing, Jackson, and Southfield. There are monthly talks and social gatherings where knowledge is exchanged, and fun is had. 

So what are you waiting for? Head to the [#misec website] and see when your closest chapter meets up next. And while you’re there, join the slack, it’s a great source of information and socializing.
