It’s a lot harder to define yourself than you would think. I’ve thought long and hard about this and decided that the individual known as Mohammad Siavoshani is a collection of mistakes and success, each and every of which has shaped me into who I am today. Sometimes I think if I could go back in time to change things, I still would keep them the same, because who knows if that would make me a better person.

Setting life and philosophy aside, I’m a young student/enthusiast based out of the Detroit Metro area in the state of Michigan. I came across the information security field a few years ago when I stumbled across a speech recorded at DEFCON. It was a fascinating talk about a risk assessment, or penetration test if you will, carried out for a bank overseas. At the time I was coming close to a two-year gap from dropping out of a pre-medical program and had zero clue what the information security field was. My only experience with computers was that I used them to play video games and complete homework assignments. The talk blew my mind and I started to try and learn more about this field. 

Now, almost four years later, I’m a senior in a Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program and have met many people in this field, many of which are brilliant people. The more I learn about this field, the more I realize that I know nothing in the grand scheme of things. That doesn’t stop me from learning as much as can however, and in an effort to document some of those learnings, I’ve started this blog. I hope it serves as something of an electronic diary of my success and failures.
