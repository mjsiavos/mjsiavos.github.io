I’m not really sure how to start this, and that’s how I’m starting it. This is the first in hopefully many posts which I plan on making on this blog. I’m creating this blog as a documentation of sorts for everything that I want to work on in my quest to learn more. 

I guess my first project is technically this blog. Even though I did “borrow” this lovely theme from [kronik3r on github], I had to make a bunch of tweaks and edits to the code to make it closer to what I wanted it to look like. I suspect sometime soon in the future I will further tweak it to make it even more my own, but that’s for another day. 

I’ve been wanted to start a blog for a while now, and I figure the present is as good a time as any, so here I am, writing this up at midnight, having finished the final touched on what the site looks like. This blog is also my first foray into websites and coding in general, with my experience limited to using basic PowerShell scripts to pull system data from machines. 

At some point I’ll start a list of items and projects I want to work on, but for now everything is pretty empty. 

Overall, I hope to learn a lot in the coming years, and I hope to also give back to those who are perhaps less experienced than I am.
